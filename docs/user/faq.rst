1. Which are the file formats supported?

A. See :ref:`file-formats-supported`.

2. Why AssimpKit?

A. See :ref:`why-assimpkit`. 

3. What is the preferred use case for using AssimpKit?

A. The preferred use case is when you are using `SceneKit`_ and want to use
   files that are not supported by `SceneKit`_ or `Model I/O`_. If your target
   app is a real time app such as a game, it is recommended that you export the
   scenes generated by AssimpKit into a native SceneKit archive and then use
   these archives. See :ref:`using-exported-scn`.
