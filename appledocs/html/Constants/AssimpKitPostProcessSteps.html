<p>The following presets can also be used for post processing:</p>

<hr></hr>


<p><b>AssimpKit_ProcessPreset_TargetRealtimeUse_Fast</b> - Default postprocess
configuration optimizing the data for real-time rendering.</p>

<p>Applications would want to use this preset to load models on end-user PCs,
maybe for direct use in game.</p>

<hr></hr>


<p><b>AssimpKit_ProcessPreset_TargetRealtime_Quality</b> - Default postprocess
configuration optimizing the data for real-time rendering.</p>

<p>Unlike AssimpKit_ProcessPreset_TargetRealtime_Fast, this configuration performs some
extra optimizations to improve rendering speed and to minimize memory usage. It
could be a good choice for a level editor environment where import speed is not
so important.</p>

<hr></hr>


<p><b>AssimpKit_ProcessPreset_TargetRealtime_MaxQuality</b> - Default postprocess
configuration optimizing the data for real-time rendering.</p>

<p>This preset enables almost every optimization step to achieve perfectly
optimized data. It&rsquo;s your choice for level editor environments where import
speed is not important.</p>

<p>Identifies and joins identical vertex data sets within all imported
meshes. After this step is run, each mesh contains unique vertices,
so a vertex may be used by multiple faces. You usually want
to use this post processing step. If your application deals with
indexed geometry, this step is compulsory or you&rsquo;ll just waste rendering
time. If this flag is not specified</b>, no vertices are referenced by
more than one face and <b>no index buffer is required</b> for rendering.</p>

<hr>Converts all the imported data to a left-handed coordinate space.


<p>By default the data is returned in a right-handed coordinate space (which
OpenGL prefers). In this space, +X points to the right,
+Z points towards the viewer, and +Y points upwards. In the DirectX
coordinate space +X points to the right, +Y points upwards, and +Z points
away from the viewer.
You&rsquo;ll probably want to consider this flag if you use Direct3D for
rendering. The AssimpKit_Process_ConvertToLeftHanded flag supersedes this
setting and bundles all conversions typically required for D3D-based
applications.</p>

<hr>Triangulates all faces of all meshes.


<p>By default the imported mesh data might contain faces with more than 3
indices. For rendering you&rsquo;ll usually want all faces to be triangles.
This post processing step splits up faces with more than 3 indices into
triangles. Line and point primitives are <em>not</em> modified! If you want
&lsquo;triangles only&rsquo; with no other kinds of primitives, try the following
solution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specify both AssimpKit_Process_Triangulate and #aiProcess_SortByPType </li>
<li>Ignore all point and line meshes when you process assimp's output</li>

<dd>


<hr>Removes some parts of the data structure (animations, materials,


<p>light sources, cameras, textures, vertex components).
The  components to be removed are specified in a separate
importer property, <tt>#AI_CONFIG_PP_RVC_FLAGS</tt>. This is quite useful
if you don&rsquo;t need all parts of the output structure. Vertex colors
are rarely used today for example&hellip; Calling this step to remove unneeded
data from the pipeline as early as possible results in increased
performance and a more optimized output data structure.
This step is also useful if you want to force Assimp to recompute
normals or tangents. The corresponding steps don&rsquo;t recompute them if
they&rsquo;re already there (loaded from the source asset). By using this
step you can make sure they are NOT there.
This flag is a poor one, mainly because its purpose is usually
misunderstood. Consider the following case: a 3D model has been exported
from a CAD app, and it has per-face vertex colors. Vertex positions can&rsquo;t be
shared, thus the AssimpKit_Process_JoinIdenticalVertices step fails to
optimize the data because of these nasty little vertex colors.
Most apps don&rsquo;t even process them, so it&rsquo;s all for nothing. By using
this step, unneeded components are excluded as early as possible
thus opening more room for internal optimizations.</p>

<hr>Generates normals for all faces of all meshes.


<p>This is ignored if normals are already there at the time this flag
is evaluated. Model importers try to load them from the source file, so
they&rsquo;re usually already there. Face normals are shared between all points
of a single face, so a single point can have multiple normals, which
forces the library to duplicate vertices in some cases.
AssimpKit_Process_JoinIdenticalVertices is <em>senseless</em> then.
This flag may not be specified together with AssimpKit_Process_GenSmoothNormals.</p>

<hr>Generates smooth normals for all vertices in the mesh.


<p>This is ignored if normals are already there at the time this flag
is evaluated. Model importers try to load them from the source file, so
they&rsquo;re usually already there.
This flag may not be specified together with
AssimpKit_Process_GenNormals. There&rsquo;s a importer property,
<tt>#AI_CONFIG_PP_GSN_MAX_SMOOTHING_ANGLE</tt> which allows you to specify
an angle maximum for the normal smoothing algorithm. Normals exceeding
this limit are not smoothed, resulting in a &lsquo;hard&rsquo; seam between two faces.
Using a decent angle here (e.g. 80 degrees) results in very good visual
appearance.</p>

<dd>


<hr>Splits large meshes into smaller sub-meshes.


<p>This is quite useful for real-time rendering, where the number of triangles
which can be maximally processed in a single draw-call is limited
by the video driver/hardware. The maximum vertex buffer is usually limited
too. Both requirements can be met with this step: you may specify both a
triangle and vertex limit for a single mesh.
The split limits can (and should!) be set through the
<tt>#AI_CONFIG_PP_SLM_VERTEX_LIMIT</tt> and <tt>#AI_CONFIG_PP_SLM_TRIANGLE_LIMIT</tt>
importer properties. The default values are <tt>#AI_SLM_DEFAULT_MAX_VERTICES</tt> and
<tt>#AI_SLM_DEFAULT_MAX_TRIANGLES</tt>.
Note that splitting is generally a time-consuming task, but only if there&rsquo;s
something to split. The use of this step is recommended for most users.</p>

<hr>Removes the node graph and pre-transforms all vertices with


<p>the local transformation matrices of their nodes.
The output scene still contains nodes, however there is only a
root node with children, each one referencing only one mesh,
and each mesh referencing one material. For rendering, you can
simply render all meshes in order - you don&rsquo;t need to pay
attention to local transformations and the node hierarchy.
Animations are removed during this step.
This step is intended for applications without a scenegraph.
The step CAN cause some problems: if e.g. a mesh of the asset
contains normals and another, using the same material index, does not,
they will be brought together, but the first meshes&rsquo;s part of
the normal list is zeroed. However, these artifacts are rare.</p>

<hr>Limits the number of bones simultaneously affecting a single vertex


<p>to a maximum value.
If any vertex is affected by more than the maximum number of bones, the least
important vertex weights are removed and the remaining vertex weights are
renormalized so that the weights still sum up to 1.
The default bone weight limit is 4 (defined as <tt>#AI_LMW_MAX_WEIGHTS</tt> in
config.h), but you can use the <tt>#AI_CONFIG_PP_LBW_MAX_WEIGHTS</tt> importer
property to supply your own limit to the post processing step.

step might be of interest to you.</p>

<hr>Validates the imported scene data structure.


<p>This makes sure that all indices are valid, all animations and
bones are linked correctly, all material references are correct .. etc.
It is recommended that you capture Assimp&rsquo;s log output if you use this flag,
so you can easily find out what&rsquo;s wrong if a file fails the
validation. The validator is quite strict and will find <em>all</em>
inconsistencies in the data structure&hellip; It is recommended that plugin
developers use it to debug their loaders. There are two types of
validation failures:</p>

<ul>
<li>Error: There's something wrong with the imported data. Further
postprocessing is not possible and the data is not usable at all.
The import fails. #Importer::GetErrorString() or #aiGetErrorString()
carry the error message around.</li>
<li>Warning: There are some minor issues (e.g. 1000000 animation
keyframes with the same time), but further postprocessing and use
of the data structure is still safe. Warning details are written
to the log file, <tt>#AI_SCENE_FLAGS_VALIDATION_WARNING</tt> is set
in #aiScene::mFlags</li>
</ul>

compulsory, but recommended.</p>

<hr>Reorders triangles for better vertex cache locality.


<p>The step tries to improve the ACMR (average post-transform vertex cache
miss ratio) for all meshes. The implementation runs in O(n) and is
roughly based on the &lsquo;tipsify&rsquo; algorithm (see <a href="
[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/pubs/Sander](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/pubs/Sander)_2007_%3ETR/tipsy.pdf">this
paper</a>).
If you intend to render huge models in hardware, this step might
be of interest to you. The <tt>#AI_CONFIG_PP_ICL_PTCACHE_SIZE</tt>
importer property can be used to fine-tune the cache optimization.</p>

<dd>


<hr>Searches for redundant/unreferenced materials and removes them.


<p>This is especially useful in combination with the
Process_PretransformVertices and Process_OptimizeMeshes flags.
Both join small meshes with equal characteristics, but they can&rsquo;t do
their work if two meshes have different materials. Because several
material settings are lost during Assimp&rsquo;s import filters,
(and because many exporters don&rsquo;t check for redundant materials), huge
models often have materials which are are defined several times with
exactly the same settings.
Several material settings not contributing to the final appearance of
a surface are ignored in all comparisons (e.g. the material name).
So, if you&rsquo;re passing additional information through the

<hr>This step tries to determine which meshes have normal vectors


<p>that are facing inwards and inverts them.
The algorithm is simple but effective:
the bounding box of all vertices + their normals is compared against
the volume of the bounding box of all vertices without their normals.
This works well for most objects, problems might occur with planar
surfaces. However, the step tries to filter such cases.
The step inverts all in-facing normals. Generally it is recommended
to enable this step, although the result is not always correct.</p>

<hr>This step splits meshes with more than one primitive type in


<p>homogeneous sub-meshes.
The step is executed after the triangulation step. After the step
returns, just one bit is set in aiMesh::mPrimitiveTypes. This is
especially useful for real-time rendering where point and line
primitives are often ignored or rendered separately.
You can use the <tt>#AI_CONFIG_PP_SBP_REMOVE</tt> importer property to
specify which primitive types you need. This can be used to easily
exclude lines and points, which are rarely used, from the import.</p>

<hr>This step searches all meshes for degenerate primitives and


<p>converts them to proper lines or points.
A face is &lsquo;degenerate&rsquo; if one or more of its points are identical.
To have the degenerate stuff not only detected and collapsed but
removed, try one of the following procedures:
<br><b>1.</b> (if you support lines and points for rendering but don&rsquo;t
want the degenerates)</br></p>

<ul>
<li>Specify the AssimpKit_Process_FindDegenerates flag.
</li>
<li>Set the <tt>#AI_CONFIG_PP_FD_REMOVE</tt> importer property to
1. This will cause the step to remove degenerate triangles from the
import as soon as they're detected. They won't pass any further
pipeline steps.
</li>
</ul>


<p><br><b>2.</b>(if you don&rsquo;t support lines and points at all)</br></p>

<ul>
<li>Specify the AssimpKit_Process_FindDegenerates flag.
</li>
<li>Specify the Process_SortByPType flag. This moves line and
point primitives to separate meshes.
</li>
<li>Set the <tt>#AI_CONFIG_PP_SBP_REMOVE</tt> importer property to
@code AssimpKit_PrimitiveType_POINTS | aiPrimitiveType_LINES
@endcode to cause SortByPType to reject point
and line meshes from the scene.

<hr>This step searches all meshes for invalid data, such as zeroed


<p>normal vectors or invalid UV coords and removes/fixes them. This is
intended to get rid of some common exporter errors.
This is especially useful for normals. If they are invalid, and
the step recognizes this, they will be removed and can later
be recomputed, i.e. by the AssimpKit_Process_GenSmoothNormals flag.<br>
The step will also remove meshes that are infinitely small and reduce
animation tracks consisting of hundreds if redundant keys to a single
key. The <tt>AI_CONFIG_PP_FID_ANIM_ACCURACY</tt> config property decides
the accuracy of the check for duplicate animation tracks.</p>

<hr>This step converts non-UV mappings (such as spherical or


<p>cylindrical mapping) to proper texture coordinate channels.
Most applications will support UV mapping only, so you will
probably want to specify this step in every case. Note that Assimp is not
always able to match the original mapping implementation of the
3D app which produced a model perfectly. It&rsquo;s always better to let the
modelling app compute the UV channels - 3ds max, Maya, Blender,
LightWave, and Modo do this for example.</p>

<hr>This step applies per-texture UV transformations and bakes


<p>them into stand-alone vtexture coordinate channels.
UV transformations are specified per-texture - see the
<tt>#AI_MATKEY_UVTRANSFORM</tt> material key for more information.
This step processes all textures with
transformed input UV coordinates and generates a new (pre-transformed)
UV Channel which replaces the old channel.
Most applications won&rsquo;t support UV transformations, so you will probably
want to specify this step.</p>

<hr>This step searches for duplicate meshes and replaces them


<p>with references to the first mesh.
This step takes a while, so don&rsquo;t use it if speed is a concern.
Its main purpose is to workaround the fact that many export
file formats don&rsquo;t support instanced meshes, so exporters need to
duplicate meshes. This step removes the duplicates again. Please
note that Assimp does not currently support per-node material
assignment to meshes, which means that identical meshes with
different materials are currently <em>not</em> joined, although this is
planned for future versions.</p>

<hr>A postprocessing step to reduce the number of meshes.


<p>This will, in fact, reduce the number of draw calls.
This is a very effective optimization and is recommended to be used
together with AssimpKit_Process_OptimizeGraph, if possible. The flag is fully
compatible with both AssimpKit_Process_SplitLargeMeshes and
AssimpKit_Process_SortByPType.</p>

<hr>A postprocessing step to optimize the scene hierarchy.


<p>Nodes without animations, bones, lights or cameras assigned are
collapsed and joined.
Node names can be lost during this step. If you use special &lsquo;tag nodes&rsquo;
to pass additional information through your content pipeline, use the
<tt>#AI_CONFIG_PP_OG_EXCLUDE_LIST</tt> importer property to specify a
list of node names you want to be kept. Nodes matching one of the names
in this list won&rsquo;t be touched or modified.
Use this flag with caution. Most simple files will be collapsed to a
single node, so complex hierarchies are usually completely lost. This is
not useful for editor environments, but probably a very effective
optimization if you just want to get the model data, convert it to your
own format, and render it as fast as possible.
This flag is designed to be used with AssimpKit_Process_OptimizeMeshes for best
results.</p>

<hr>This step flips all UV coordinates along the y-axis and adjusts


<p>material settings and bitangents accordingly.
You&rsquo;ll probably want to consider this flag if you use Direct3D for
rendering. The AssimpKit_Process_ConvertToLeftHanded flag supersedes this
setting and bundles all conversions typically required for D3D-based
applications.</p>

<hr>This step removes bones losslessly or according to some threshold.


<p>In some cases (i.e. formats that require it) exporters are forced to
assign dummy bone weights to otherwise static meshes assigned to
animated meshes. Full, weight-based skinning is expensive while
animating nodes is extremely cheap, so this step is offered to clean up
the data in that regard.</p>
